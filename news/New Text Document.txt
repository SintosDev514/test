SAMELCO I Participates in City’s Dengue Clean-Up Drive
In response to the rising number of dengue cases in Calbayog, SAMELCO I employees took part in a comprehensive dengue clean-up drive.
The clean-up drive at SAMELCO I’s compound, spearheaded by Atty. Edson G. Piczon and led by Mr. Mark A. Diaz, CPA, Officer-in-Charge of the Member Services Department, was held in support of Calbayog City Mayor Raymund Uy’s memorandum. This initiative, which is also endorsed by Congressman Stephen James Tan, encourages organizations to participate in efforts to eliminate mosquito breeding sites.
By actively engaging in this effort, SAMELCO I reaffirms its commitment to community health and safety as part of its corporate social responsibility.
