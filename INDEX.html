          Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease, continues to significantly
          impact tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. As of April 2024,
          over 7.6 million cases have been reported globally, with the Americas
          experiencing a marked increase. Children, often more vulnerable to
          severe symptoms, remain a key demographic in these statistics

          In the Philippines, dengue remains a significant public health
          concern, with a notable increase in cases this year. As of September
          2024, over 208,000 dengue cases were reported, marking a substantial
          rise compared to the previous year. This includes a 33% increase in
          cases from the first half of the year compared to 2023. However, the
          case fatality rate has slightly improved, with 396 deaths reported by
          mid-year, compared to 421 during the same period last year

          In Calbayog City, Samar, dengue cases have significantly increased in
          2024. From January to mid-August, the city recorded 422 cases, a
          dramatic rise compared to just 83 cases during the same period in
          2023. Two dengue-related deaths have been reported this year. Out of
          the city’s 157 villages, 57 have been affected, including 20 within
          the city proper.
          <br />
          To combat this surge, Calbayog City was declared under a state of
          calamity, enabling the allocation of emergency response funds. Local
          authorities have intensified efforts such as clean-up drives to
          destroy mosquito breeding sites and implementing measures to protect
          children in schools. Residents are encouraged to follow dengue
          prevention strategies, including the 5S approach: search and destroy
          mosquito habitats, practice self-protection, seek early medical
          consultation, support fogging operations, and maintain hydration
